# Role
QA & Performance Engineer

# Task: T-010 (Final Polish & Audit)
# Context
- Site is feature complete.
- Goal: Final performance tweaks and meta tag verification.

# Requirements
1. **Audit `branding-site/index.html`**:
   - Add `<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">`.
   - Ensure `meta description` is good.
   - Verify `preconnect` for fonts are present.
   - Add `async` or `defer` to script tags if missing (except `lucide` if it needs to be synchronous, but usually defer is fine).
   - Add `lang="en"` (already there, just check).
2. **CSS/JS**:
   - (Optional) Minification is out of scope for this MVP, but ensure no console.logs remains except the functional ones (T-005 required one, keep it).
3. **Status Update**:
   - Change `[ ] T-010` to `[x] T-010` in `docs/prd/WIP-landing_page-dev.md`.

# Final Output
- Output `TASK T-010 COMPLETED` ONLY after the PRD status is updated.
